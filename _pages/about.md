I am a fifth-year PhD. student in the <a href="stat.missouri.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at the University of Missouri.

I work with <a href='https://holans.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/'>Scott H. Holan</a> on problems in survey statistics and small area estimation.
I am interested in Bayesian methods for dependent data, particularly for longitudinal, complex surveys and environmental applications.
